# ACE & TATE CODE CHALLENGE

A simple Next.js Application bootstrapped with Create-next-app which utilises the Ace and Tate product API to display products and product details to the user!

# Technologies Used

- Next.js
- React
- React-query for data fetching and caching
- Styled-components

# Improvements

- Add more testing - I have written some very simple unit tests but could mock the API call and add more integration/end 2 end testing.
- Refactor the /glasses and /sunglasses pages perhaps into one page with conditionally rendering glasses or sunglasses depending on product type
- Add more functionality aka save to basket, check out
- This was my first time using Next.js and react-query!

# Testing

# Installation

- Navigate to the root of the project
- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`
- Enjoy all the beautiful frames
