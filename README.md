# ACE & TATE CODE CHALLENGE

A simple Next.js Application bootstrapped with Create-next-app which utilises the Ace and Tate product API to display products and product details to the user!

# Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for data fetching and caching
- [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com)

# Improvements

- Add more testing - I have written some very simple unit tests but could mock the API call and add more integration/end 2 end testing.
- Refactor the /glasses and /sunglasses pages perhaps into one page with conditionally rendering glasses or sunglasses depending on product type
- Add more functionality aka save to basket, check out
- This was my first time using Next.js and react-query!
